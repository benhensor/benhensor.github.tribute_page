            What is The Simulation Hypothesis?
          </h3>
          <div class="textbox">
            <div class="text">
              The Simulation Hypothesis suggests that our existence is a highly advanced simulated reality. The theory encapsulates the totality of human sensory experience and has profound consequences in the fields of epistemology and philosophy. Sharing similarities with many historic philosophical thought experiments, aspects of the theory have been depicted in popular culture yet the broader themes are heavily disputed by scientists in many fields.

              Origins of The Simulation Hypothesis
            </h3>

          <div class="textbox">
            <div class="text">
              The theory in it's modern form was first proposed in a 2003 paper by philosopher Nick Bostrom. The basic premise states that if there are long-lived technological civilizations in the universe, and if they run computer simulations, there must be a huge number of simulated realities complete with artificially intelligent inhabitants who may have no idea theyâ€™re living inside a simulation.
              <br>
              The inhabitants of such simulations might imagine themselves real but would have no physical form, existing only within the simulation.
              <br>
              If advanced civilisations with enormous computational power truly exist, Bostrum argued, <q><i>we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation.</i></q>

            <h3>
              The Trilemma
            </h3>
            <div class="text">
              The Simulation Argument can be expressed with the following three statements:
            </div>
            <ul>
            <li>1. "The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage (that is, one capable of running high-fidelity ancestor simulations) is very close to zero", or</li>
            <li>2. "The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running simulations of their evolutionary history, or variations thereof, is very close to zero", or</li>
            <li>3. "The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one."</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="text">A form of Anthropic Reasoning is then deployed to consider the arguments.</div>
            <ul>
            <li>If (1) is true, then we will almost certainly go extinct before reaching posthumanity.</li>
            <li>If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any individuals who desire to run ancestor-simulations and are free to do so.</li>
            <li>If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation.</li>
            </ul>

              Famous Advocates and Critiques
            </h3>
            <div class="text">
              Notable proponents of the theory include tech entrepreneur Elon Musk and astrophysicist Neil Degrasse Tyson although the latter has since disclosed revisions in his thinking. Critics of the hypothesis point to the validity of the predictions, citing the problems presented by the assumptions that are required for the arguments to work. Since it's modern inception, the theory remains a popular subject for exploration in science fiction and continues to generate vigorous debate amongst the scientific community and the wider population.
